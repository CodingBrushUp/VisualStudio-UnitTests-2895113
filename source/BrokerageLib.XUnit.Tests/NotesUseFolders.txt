A concept I've seen for test organization with folders

Use .NET namespaces to help, one namespace for each class

BrokerageLib.Tests <== the main namespace
BrokerageLib.Tests.Account
BrokerageLib.Tests.CommissionCalculator
BrokerageLib.Test.Financial
BrokerageLib.Test.PaymentDate

Create a folder in the test project for each classname, 
and Visual Studio will automatically use for namespace name.


In the folder, create one class for each method in the class

Account
  Debit
  Credit
CommissionCalculator
  GetCommissionForTheSale
Financial
  GetRateOfReturn
  GetAnnualizedRateOfReturn
  CalculateLoanPayment
PaymentDate
  CalculateFuturePaymentDate
